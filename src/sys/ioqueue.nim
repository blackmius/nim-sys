    ## This is considered a programming error due to the fact that some
    ## operating system might keep reporting events for the "closed" resource
    ## since it might be kept alive by other hidden references (ie. `dup` on
    ## a fd will cause epoll to keep reporting event for the original even
    ## if the original is closed).
    ##
    ## To avoid this, unregister the resource from the queue before invalidating
    ## it.

  ##
  ## However, this means `poll()` will always return when an event occurs on
  ## `fd` even if it is not being waited on and might degrade performance.
  ##
  ## Deassociation can be done via `unregister() <#unregister,AnyFD>_`.
  ##
  ## **Note**: Any FD marked as persistent must be unregistered before
  ## closing, even on Windows. Failure to do so will raise a `Defect`.
  ## This error checking will only happen on non-release builds.
  ##
  ## Currently this is only implemented for Windows.
  ##
  ## ** Platform specific details **
  ##
  ## - On Windows, `fd` is permanently bound to the queue for the duration of
  ##   its lifetime and cannot be unbound via `unregister()`, which also
  ##   prevents it from being bound to any other queue.
  ##
  ## - On Windows, `fd` is set to skip posting a packet to IOCP if the
  ##   operation is finished synchronously.
